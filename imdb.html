                    After racing through four seasons in two months, then restraining myself from binge-watching
                    the start of season 5 after Thanksgiving dinner, I'm facing a hard truth: I'm not ready for
                    this story to end. It's hard to believe we've been on this adventure for almost a decade
                    (and watched Millie, Finn, Caleb and the gang grow into their twenties!).
                    This Christmas, the party makes their final stand against Vecna and The Upside Down.
                    May all of their rolls be natural twenties. Three episodes left, gang. We can do this!
